That is totally up to you. Weâ€™re flexible with clients and understand that there are usually two schools of thought: a) You want to pay experts like us to build and run your platform on an ongoing basis OR b) You want to pay experts like us to build it, but want your internal teams to run it going forward. We happily support both of those options!

To set the table, we as an organization rarely use outside vendors due to our high quality standards; however, our team decided to evaluate Masterpoint based on a recommendation from one of our executives.  After a stringent vetting process, we engaged a lead technical architect from Masterpoint who came on board and provided considerable value to a critical part of our business within the first month of our engagement. We are delighted with Masterpointâ€™s performance over the past year and highly recommend their team to any company who can benefit from innovative / thoughtful technical solutions delivered in a disciplined manner with strong consultative leadership.

“As an early stage consulting agency, we could not have been happier with the AWS platform that Masterpoint spearheaded for one of our largest clients. Their expertise in cloud architecture and automation filled a critical knowledge gap on our team that was vital to the project's success. We continue to call on their expertise in the cloud space for both internal and external projects as we believe strongly that Matt and his team are an indispensable resource for our business.”

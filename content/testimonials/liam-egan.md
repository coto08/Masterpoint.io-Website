We engaged Masterpoint to help us transition a legacy web application to AWS and it's difficult to boil down what makes them such a wonderful resource to just a few attributes, but among them are: professionalism; dedication to quality; clear and concise communication skills; and thorough cloud/AWS expertise. After engaging them on this initial contract, we'll definitely be engaging their services again in the future.

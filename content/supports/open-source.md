title: Open Source
description: >-
   We live and breathe open source, so much so that weâ€™re contributors, maintainers, and sponsors of hundreds of open source projects across multiple organizations. We believe our open source first approach is critical to how we operate efficiently and effectively for our clients. Collectively, the Masterpoint team has spent well over $20K sponsoring and maintaining open source projects.

* **[Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-monthly):** A reliable organization that provides medical care and defense analytics to the military and veterans in Ukraine.
* **[Hospitallers](https://www.hospitallers.life/needs-hospitallers):** A volunteer organization of paramedics that provides care and training to those on the front line of the conflict.
* **[UAnimals](https://uanimals.org/en/how-to-help/):** A humanitarian movement that helps animals within war zones by evacuating them and providing food and medicine for shelters.
* **[United24](https://u24.gov.ua/):** An initiative of President Zelenskyy that focuses on defense, removing mines, medical aid, and rebuilding Ukraine.

We are proud to support these organizations, and we hope that you will consider donating to them as well to help Ukraine win this ongoing conflict. Together, we can make a difference and support those who have been affected by Russia's unjust war. Thank you for your support!

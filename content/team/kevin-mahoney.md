Originally from Ohio, Kevin is a platform engineer who has just recently moved to Budapest, Hungary. He enjoys building platforms that improve operational efficiency and discovering force multipliers to make software delivery faster and more reliable. Outside of work, he's a big fan of traveling the globe, trying new foods, and teaching his dog human-like tricks (like picking up items, climbing ladders, and counting).
